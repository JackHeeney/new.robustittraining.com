                            It is up to you to check that your order is correct. There are facilities to enable you to
                            correct any inputting errors prior to the submission of your order. If however you realize
                            that you have made a mistake then please call us and we will see whether it is possible to
                            intercept the order before it is accepted by us. Please note that our online courses are
                            compatible with 99.9% of MAC based computers. If the course is not compatible with your MAC,
                            or you would like to access the training from an iPad, please contact us for a alternative

                            We are not obliged to supply goods or services to you until we have confirmed acceptance of
                            your order and this is when the contract is made. This is generally done via email under the
                            heading "Confirmed Order". If you have not supplied us with an email address then we will
                            send a written "Confirmed Order" to you at any other address that you have given to us.

                            Any delay in payment by the agreed payment date may incur a £10 administration fee also the

                        <p>
                            When a payment scheme has been agreed and contracted into and cleared funds covering the
                            first payment has been received by Robust IT then the relevant course(s)or portions of
                            courses will be made available to the purchaser, for the agreed amount of time (e.g. 12
                            months).
                        </p>

                            Failure to comply with any agreed payment plan by the purchaser will result in the relevant
                            course(s) or portions of courses being suspended, Robust IT reserves the right to suspend
                            any training course in these circumstances. After 3 months payments have been missed.

                        <h3 class="sub-title">1.8 Course Packages (Including Exams)</h3>
                        <p>
                            All course licenses are 12 months unless otherwise agreed prior to setup in writing. As such
                            all exams on a student's account must be taken before this 12 month license expires. Exam
                            credits will be given only on exam booking. When a package of courses is agreed, the
                            subsequent course must be commenced within 12 months and the licence for that course will
                            also be subject to 12 months from commencement.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Any course package which is over 12 months expiry period must be agreed by Robust IT in
                            writing and upon request the customer must provide the written confirmation.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            As the exam vouchers are controlled via a third-party vendor (Microsoft, CompTIA, Cisco
                            etc.), if a course is paused, we are unable to pause the licence on the vouchers. The
                            licence of the voucher(s) will begin when the course is purchased and will end after 12
                            months, unless otherwise stated. Vouchers will be provided only when the courseware has been
                            completed and three-four of the associated mocks exams have been completed with 85% or
                            above, at least three in certification mode. Vouchers will only be provided to the student
                            when the tutoring team are confident that the student is ready for the exam, as they will
                            have to be re-purchased.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            When a package of courses are provided, if having taken one of these courses, (and exam if
                            applicable), it will not be possible to refund this under any circumstances and the full
                            price will then be applicable.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Please Note: As the exams are conducted through either PearsonVue or Certiport, and due to
                            the data protection policies they have in place, we are unable to make any changes to exam
                            bookings. The student will need to contact the relevant exam proctor directly. Where an exam
                            is cancelled the full cost of the exam will be applied to the student.

                            If included within the training package purchased from Robust IT, free re-takes will only
                            apply if students achieve a pass mark of 85% or higher on all provided mock exams. Free
                            re-takes are only applicable to exams that have been booked through Robust IT.

                            Where a course is sold with unlimited resits if an exam is failed it maybe required for the
                            student to complete a retraining programme with our trainer refusal to do this will mean
                            that the unlimited re sit offer is void and the student will only receive one re sit per
                            module.
                        </p>

                            To qualify for a free re-sit of any exam, students must first sit any supplied mock exams
                            and pass three tests in 'Certification mode', with at least one result surpassing a score of
                            90%.

                            The student understands that if they are unsuccessful in their exam attempt, they must wait
                            a minimum of two weeks before booking the resit.

                            If payments are not kept up-to-date, then the student will lose their rights to

                            Please note: MTA & MOS exams do not qualify. All mock exams are issued with a 180-day
                            licence, after this period of time students will need to purchase a new mock exam licence.

                            All exam re-sits are at the discretion of the management. Please also note that mock exams
                            for MTAs are valid for only 30 days. If additional time is required, the student may be
                            required to pay an additional charge.

                            Anyone taking Microsoft MOS please be aware that free resits are only accepted at Microsoft
                            Exam Centres that accept the Microsoft exam vouchers. The re-sit will also have to be taken
                            within 30 days of the initial exam. Please also note that exams centres can charge a centre
                            fee, and this is beyond our control.
