                    personal, employment and financial situation. Deko will need to share your personal data with
                    Snap Finance Ltd - the lender, so that they can make a decision about whether to offer you
                    finance. Snap Finance will perform a search with one or more Credit Reference Agencies to

                <h2 class="title py-5">Finance decision</h2>

                <p>Your application will be assessed based on eligibility, credit history and affordability and Deko
                    will let you know the outcome in just a few seconds. It’s important to know that when applying
                    for finance a credit check is made which is recorded on your credit file.
                </p>
                <p>The loan amount, loan term and interest rate the lender is willing to offer you will be decided
                    based on these checks and the lender’s decisioning policies.</p>
                <p>
                    Once approved, Deko will provide you with full details about your lender, including how to
                    contact them. You then just need to digitally sign your credit agreement, pay your deposit and
                    wait for your order to arrive.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In a few cases, your application may be referred to your lender for manual assessment and you’ll
                    be notified by email of the credit decision within 24 hours. If you’re not approved for finance,
                    it could be for a variety of reasons and the lender will be able to give you more information.
