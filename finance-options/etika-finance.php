                    Our goal in putting this package together was to cover what the industry requires to make you
                    effective in the workplace. We have reverse-engineered the training by looking at what the job
                    markets ask for in cyber roles and worked back to the basics. The idea is to keep as many options as
                    possible within the industry open to you once qualified.
